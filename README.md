Why doesn't the integer change after the method call?
**The interger does not change after the method call beacuse the number variable is not stored in the memory. Considering the fact that the function makes a new interger using the number variable and not updating it the original value will not be modified**
Why does the array change after the method call?
**This is because an array is stored in memory. Meaning when it is changed it will always be changed no matter where it is in a class.**
What happens when you try to access y outside the loop?
**It is not possible, as the y is declared inside the loop.**
